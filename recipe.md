Roast the puffed rice for 2 to 3 minutes they become crisp. You don’t need to brown them. Let the puffed rice cool at room temperature.
Assemble everything before you begin. Keep the chutneys in a bowl. These chutneys stay well for about a week in the fridge. So you can keep the leftovers in the fridge.
In a bowl now take the chopped boiled potatoes, onions and tomatoes. You can also add some boiled moong beans or steamed moong bean sprouts at this step.
Add sweet chutney, green chutney and red chutney. You can add the amount of chutneys as per the taste you want in a bhel puri. So for a spicy bhel puri, add more of red chutney and green chutney. For a sweet taste add more of the sweet chutney. So add accordingly.
Add ½ to 1 teaspoon chaat masala and ½ teaspoon roasted cumin powder. Also add some black salt as per taste. If you do not have black salt, then use pink salt, rock salt or white salt.
Drizzle ½ to 1 teaspoon lemon juice or add as per taste. mix very well.
Now add 1 tablespoon masala chana (optional) and 2 tablespoons roasted peanuts. at this step you can also add some crushed puri or papdi. 
Add the puffed rice. add ¼ cup sev (fried gram flour vermicelli).
With a spoon, just swirl the whole bhelpuri mixture together well and be quick.
Serve bhel puri immediately in individual bowls or plates. Top up with some sev and more coriander leaves if you want. If you don’t serve bhelpuri immediately then it will become soggy and you won’t enjoy it. So be quick in serving.
